### [Try it out](https://sucrase.io)

Sucrase is an alternative to Babel that allows super-fast development builds.
Instead of compiling a large range of JS features down to ES5, Sucrase assumes
that you're targeting a modern JS runtime (e.g. Node.js 8 or latest Chrome) and
focuses on compiling non-standard language extensions: JSX, TypeScript, and
Flow. Because of this smaller scope, Sucrase can get away with an architecture
that is much more performant but less extensible and maintainable. Sucrase's
parser is forked from Babel's parser (so Sucrase is indebted to Babel and
wouldn't be possible without it) and trims it down to focus on a small subset of
what Babel solves. If it fits your use case, hopefully Sucrase can speed up your
development experience!

**Current state:** The project is in active development. It is about 20x faster
than Babel and about 8x faster than TypeScript, and it has been tested on
hundreds of thousands of lines of code. Still, you may find correctness issues
when running on a large codebase. Feel free to file issues!

Sucrase can build the following codebases with all tests passing:
* Sucrase itself (6K lines of code excluding Babel parser fork, typescript,
  imports).
* The [Benchling](https://benchling.com/) frontend codebase
  (500K lines of code, JSX, typescript, imports).
* [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel) (63K lines of code, flow, imports).
* [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) (86K lines of code, JSX, flow,
  imports).
* [TSLint](https://github.com/palantir/tslint) (20K lines of code, typescript,
  imports).
* [Apollo client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client) (34K lines of
  code, typescript, imports)
* [decaffeinate](https://github.com/decaffeinate/decaffeinate) and its
  sub-projects [decaffeinate-parser](https://github.com/decaffeinate/decaffeinate-parser)
  and [coffee-lex](https://github.com/decaffeinate/coffee-lex)
  (38K lines of code, typescript, imports).

## Transforms

The main configuration option in Sucrase is an array of transform names. There
are four main transforms that you may want to enable:
* **jsx**: Transforms JSX syntax to `React.createElement`, e.g. `<div a={b} />`
  becomes `React.createElement('div', {a: b})`. Behaves like Babel 7's
  [babel-preset-react](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages/babel-preset-react),
  including adding `createReactClass` display names and JSX context information.
* **typescript**: Compiles TypeScript code to JavaScript, removing type
  annotations and handling features like enums. Does not check types.
* **flow**:  Removes Flow type annotations. Does not check types.
* **imports**: Transforms ES Modules (`import`/`export`) to CommonJS
  (`require`/`module.exports`) using the same approach as Babel 6 and TypeScript
  with `--esModuleInterop`. Also includes dynamic `import`.

The following proposed JS features are built-in and always transformed:
* [Class fields](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields): `class C { x = 1; }`.
  This includes static fields but not the `#x` private field syntax.
* [Export namespace syntax](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-export-ns-from):
  `export * as a from 'a';`
* [Numeric separators](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-numeric-separator):
  `const n = 1_234;`
* [Optional catch binding](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-catch-binding):
  `try { doThing(); } catch { }`.

### JSX Options
Like Babel, Sucrase compiles JSX to React functions by default, but can be
configured for any JSX use case.
* **jsxPragma**: Element creation function, defaults to `React.createElement`.
* **jsxFragmentPragma**: Fragment component, defaults to `React.Fragment`.

### Legacy CommonJS interop
Two legacy modes can be used with the `import` tranform:
* **enableLegacyTypeScriptModuleInterop**: Use the default TypeScript approach
  to CommonJS interop instead of assuming that TypeScript's `--esModuleInterop`
  flag is enabled. For example, if a CJS module exports a function, legacy
  TypeScript interop requires you to write `import * as add from './add';`,
  while Babel, Webpack, Node.js, and TypeScript with `--esModuleInterop` require
  you to write `import add from './add';`. As mentioned in the
  [docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-7.html#support-for-import-d-from-cjs-form-commonjs-modules-with---esmoduleinterop),
  the TypeScript team recommends you always use `--esModuleInterop`.
* **enableLegacyBabel5ModuleInterop**: Use the Babel 5 approach to CommonJS
  interop, so that you can run `require('./MyModule')` instead of
  `require('./MyModule').default`. Analogous to
  [babel-plugin-add-module-exports](https://github.com/59naga/babel-plugin-add-module-exports).

## Usage

Installation:

```
yarn add --dev sucrase  # Or npm install --save-dev sucrase
```

Run on a directory:

```
sucrase ./srcDir -d ./outDir --transforms typescript,imports
```

Compile on-the-fly via a require hook with some [reasonable defaults](src/register.ts):

```js
// Register just one extension.
import "sucrase/register/ts";
// Or register all at once.
import "sucrase/register";
```

Compile on-the-fly via a drop-in replacement for node:

```
sucrase-node index.ts
```

Call from JS directly:

```js
import {transform} from "sucrase";
const compiledCode = transform(code, {transforms: ["typescript", "imports"]}).code;
```

There are also integrations for
[Webpack](https://github.com/alangpierce/sucrase/tree/master/integrations/webpack-loader),
[Gulp](https://github.com/alangpierce/sucrase/tree/master/integrations/gulp-plugin),
[Jest](https://github.com/alangpierce/sucrase/tree/master/integrations/jest-plugin) and
[Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-sucrase).

## What Sucrase is not

Sucrase is intended to be useful for the most common cases, but it does not aim
to have nearly the scope and versatility of Babel. Some specific examples:

* Sucrase does not check your code for errors. Sucrase's contract is that if you
  give it valid code, it will produce valid JS code. If you give it invalid
  code, it might produce invalid code, it might produce valid code, or it might
  give an error. Always use Sucrase with a linter or typechecker, which is more
  suited for error-checking.
* Sucrase is not pluginizable. With the current architecture, transforms need to
  be explicitly written to cooperate with each other, so each additional
  transform takes significant extra work.
* Sucrase is not good for prototyping language extensions and upcoming language
  features. Its faster architecture makes new transforms more difficult to write
  and more fragile.
* Sucrase will never produce code for old browsers like IE. Compiling code down
  to ES5 is much more complicated than any transformations that Sucrase needs to
  do.
* Sucrase is hesitant to implement upcoming JS features, although some of them
  make sense to implement for pragmatic reasons. Its main focus is on language
  extensions (JSX, TypeScript, Flow) that will never be supported by JS
  runtimes.
* Like Babel, Sucrase is not a typechecker, and must process each file in
  isolation. For example, TypeScript `const enum`s are treated as regular
  `enum`s rather than inlining across files.
* You should think carefully before using Sucrase in production. Sucrase is
  mostly beneficial in development, and in many cases, Babel or tsc will be more
  suitable for production builds.

## Motivation

As JavaScript implementations mature, it becomes more and more reasonable to
disable Babel transforms, especially in development when you know that you're
targeting a modern runtime. You might hope that you could simplify and speed up
the build step by eventually disabling Babel entirely, but this isn't possible
if you're using a non-standard language extension like JSX, TypeScript, or Flow.
Unfortunately, disabling most transforms in Babel doesn't speed it up as much as
you might expect. To understand, let's take a look at how Babel works:

1. Tokenize the input source code into a token stream.
2. Parse the token stream into an AST.
3. Walk the AST to compute the scope information for each variable.
4. Apply all transform plugins in a single traversal, resulting in a new AST.
5. Print the resulting AST.

Only step 4 gets faster when disabling plugins, so there's always a fixed cost
to running Babel regardless of how many transforms are enabled.

Sucrase bypasses most of these steps, and works like this:
1. Tokenize the input source code into a token stream using a trimmed-down fork
   of the Babel parser. This fork does not produce a full AST, but still
   produces meaningful token metadata specifically designed for the later
   transforms.
2. Scan through the tokens, computing preliminary information like all
   imported/exported names.
3. Run the transform by doing a pass through the tokens and performing a number
   of careful find-and-replace operations, like replacing `<Foo` with
   `React.createElement(Foo`.

Because Sucrase works on a lower level and uses a custom parser for its use
case, it is much faster than Babel.

## Performance

Currently, Sucrase runs about 20x faster than Babel (even when Babel only runs
the relevant transforms) and 8x faster than TypeScript. Here's the output of
one run of `npm run benchmark`:

```
Simulating transpilation of 100,000 lines of code:
Sucrase: 469.672ms
TypeScript: 3782.414ms
Babel: 9591.515ms
```

## Project vision and future work

### Performance improvements

* Rewrite the code to run in WebAssembly, either by changing it to be valid
  [AssemblyScript](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript) or by
  rewriting it in Rust.
* Explore the idea of a JIT to optimize the various token patterns that need to
  be matched as part of code transformation.

### New features

* Implement more integrations, like a Browserify plugin.
* Emit proper source maps. (The line numbers already match up, but this would
  help with debuggers and other tools.)
* Rethink configuration and try to simplify it as much as possible, and allow
  loading Babel/TypeScript configurations.
* Explore the idea of a tool that patches a Babel/TypeScript installation to
  use Sucrase instead, to make it even easier to try Sucrase on an existing
  codebase.
* Explore the idea of extending this approach to other tools, e.g. module
  bundlers.

### Correctness and stability

* Add more open source projects to the suite of projects that are tested
  automatically.
* Set up a test suite that runs the compiled code and ensures that it is
  correct.
* Add integrity checks to compare intermediate Sucrase results (like tokens and
  the role of each identifier and pair of curly braces) with the equivalent
  information from Babel.
* Fix some known correctness loose ends, like import hoisting and fully
  replicating the small differences between Babel and the TypeScript compiler.
